                <p class="container-fluid aboutp">
                    I specialize in building dynamic, user-friendly web applications with a strong emphasis on frontend technologies and design. My passion lies in creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces that provide seamless user experiences. Proficient in modern web development frameworks and tools, I leverage technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to deliver high-quality, responsive applications tailored to client and user needs.

                <p class="container-fluid about2">
                    While my expertise is primarily frontend-focused, I also have hands-on experience in backend development. I’ve worked on creating scalable APIs, managing databases, and ensuring smooth integration across the entire development stack. This full-stack capability enables me to contribute to projects holistically, bridging the gap between user interface design and robust backend functionality. By understanding the end-to-end development process, I ensure the applications I build are not only visually appealing but also technically sound and efficient.

                <p class="container-fluid about2">
                    My technical skills were honed through a comprehensive full-stack web development bootcamp, where I gained practical experience in both frontend and backend development. This immersive training equipped me with the ability to tackle real-world projects and problem-solving scenarios effectively. Additionally, my academic foundation in business principles, earned through an Associate’s Degree in Science, provides me with a strategic perspective on aligning technical solutions with organizational goals.

                    Prior to transitioning into web development, I built a strong background in sales and customer service. This experience enhanced my ability to communicate effectively with clients and stakeholders, ensuring their needs and expectations are met throughout the development process. I excel at translating user requirements into functional, impactful solutions that address both user experience and business objectives. My diverse background allows me to approach development projects with a unique blend of technical expertise and customer-centric thinking.
